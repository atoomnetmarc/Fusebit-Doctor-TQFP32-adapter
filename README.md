This is a Fusebit Doctor TQFP32 adapter. It fits any Fusebit Doctor compatible programmer, like my [Yet Another AVR Fusebit Rescuer](https://github.com/atoomnetmarc/yaafr).

You could start pressing lightly on the case and then press the erase button on the Fusebit Doctor, when fail erasing press somewhat harder and try again.
